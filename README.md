# **Mason Jar**

Mason Jar is a web app written in Javascript. The app provides users with information about music events (within an indicated date range) happening near them. Once an artist, location and date range (captured with Datepicker.js) are searched, the app makes an AJAX call to the Google API, which returns the best matches for the search input. Once the best matches are displayed, users can select the one they are most interested in, and view a map of the event location. Mason Jar is deployed on Github!


## **How to Use Mason Jar:**

Click on the following link to try out Mason Jar: [Mason Jar](https://dalep1988.github.io/Project-1-MasonJar/). 
From the main page, complete the fields for artist and location and select a date from the calendar. Once you click submit, a number of event matches will appear. When you click on the event that most interests you, the app will display a Google map of the event location.
